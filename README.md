    - Xamarin Binding Library that uses "SwiftFrameworkProxy" Wrapper Framework and expose "StartWithClientKey" function that only method you need.
      -  _nid = new SwiftFrameworkProxy();
      -  var sessionId = _nid.StartWithClientKey("key", "formId", true);
      -  You can either use the SessionId generated by startWithClientKey function and pass it to your backend and use when you make a NeuroID - Analytics API Call or use the "setUserIdWithUserId" function to set the userId if It's available.
      -  _nid.SetUserIdWithUserId("BurakTestUser");
